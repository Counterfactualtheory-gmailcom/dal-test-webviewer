### An AI system engineered to prevent hallucinations by design

**Where AI stops guessing.**

## What COMPAiSS Does

Websites for regulated institutions contain thousands of pages of information - policies, procedures, rules, and support resources - typically distributed across multiple departments, administrative offices, and service units. For most users, navigating these opaque websites to find the right answer quickly is a daunting proposition.

Universities are a clear example of this challenge.

A university’s web ecosystem spans academic policies, program requirements, admissions rules, financial regulations, accessibility services, immigration guidance, housing, health services, and student rights - each governed by different offices and updated on different schedules.

Students trying to understand how a university actually works often begin in the same place: the university website.

A domestic student may be looking for clarity on academic standing, accommodations, course requirements, transfer credits, student loans, or financial policies. An international student may be trying to understand student visa regulations, work eligibility, health coverage, or immigration-related rules. Prospective students may be comparing programs, admissions criteria, deadlines, or available supports.

In all cases, the information usually exists - but it is spread across hundreds or thousands of webpages and policy documents.

COMPAiSS solves this problem for universities and other highly regulated institutions (such as hospitals and government service departments) that have an obligation to provide clear, accurate, and authoritative information, all delivered *in any language* the user prefers.

---

## The Problem with Most AI Systems Today

As a direct consequence of complex institutional web ecosystems, many users turn to consumer-based AI systems (ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, and similar tools) to obtain fast, clear answers to institution-specific questions.

But consumer AI models are designed to generate responses by default. They optimize for broad usefulness across a vast training base that can reasonably be described as a universe of knowledge. When these systems are applied to narrow, institution-specific questions, errors, hallucinations, and references to non-authoritative or external sources are a predictable byproduct of that design.

The AI industry readily acknowledges these facts - incorrect or unsupported answers are generally treated as expected outcomes to be managed rather than failures to be prevented. This trade-off is widely accepted as the cost of maintaining broad, open-ended access to general knowledge.

There are also strong economic incentives to preserve this generation-first model. Managing risk after answers are produced enables entire ecosystems of enterprise features - monitoring tools, compliance dashboards, moderation layers, human review workflows, and governance add-ons - that are costly to build, costly to operate, and highly profitable to sell. 

In regulated institutional environments, however, this approach introduces risks that are difficult - if not impossible - to fully mitigate after an answer has already been delivered. To compensate, vendors typically recommend layering additional controls and liability protections on top of generative systems, such as disclaimers and legal compliance frameworks.

These measures may reduce exposure, but they do not change the underlying generation-first architecture or eliminate the root causes of hallucinations. 

In regulated institutional environments, this leaves a fundamental gap - one that COMPAiSS is designed to address by introducing an architectural innovation that prevents unsupported answers from being generated in the first place.

---

## How COMPAiSS Works Differently

Instead of generating an answer by default and attempting to manage risk afterward, COMPAiSS evaluates each question before any response is permitted to occur.

When a question is asked, the system first determines:

- whether the question falls within an institution’s defined scope
- whether authoritative, institution-approved material exists to support an answer
- and whether producing an answer would be responsible and defensible

The AI model is only allowed to provide an answer when those conditions are met.

This means COMPAiSS does not rely on disclaimers, confidence scores, post-answer filtering, or human review to retrofit compliance after an answer has already been produced. Unsupported or out-of-scope questions are prevented from triggering the AI in the first place.

This pre-generation gating alone eliminates a significant class of errors common to consumer AI systems, where answers appear plausible and well-linked but are drawn from non-authoritative or external sources that only seem institutionally relevant.

When a question is clearly institution-specific and authoritative information exists within approved sources, COMPAiSS produces a clear answer grounded exclusively in that institution’s authorized materials - not inferred from the broader universe of unrelated organizations or jurisdictions. When a question cannot be supported, the system does not guess, generalize, fill gaps, or improvise simply to be helpful.

By shifting decision-making ahead of AI generation, COMPAiSS removes the need for many of the costly corrective controls required by generation-first AI systems and eliminates a major class of hallucinations by design.

---

## Why COMPAiSS Is Not a General-Purpose AI Model

General-purpose AI systems are designed to answer questions about anything. Their value lies in breadth: the ability to move freely across domains, institutions, jurisdictions, and topics by inferring context and generalizing from a vast, heterogeneous training base.

COMPAiSS is not built for breadth; it is intentionally built for institutional specificity. This alone removes errors and risks by operating inside a single, well-defined organizational context, where authority, responsibility, and accountability matter more than coverage - particularly in regulated or policy-bound environments.

Its purpose is not to approximate an answer from general knowledge, but to reflect *only* what a particular institution has actually authorized as its official position, policy, or guidance. This makes COMPAiSS more suitable for environments where answers must be traceable, defensible, and consistent over time and across audiences.

In short, general-purpose AI optimizes for how much it can answer.

COMPAiSS optimizes for when it is appropriate to provide answers about your institution, based on your information - and when it is not.

---

## Why COMPAiSS Is Not a FAQ Bot or Scripted Chatbot

FAQ systems are built around predefined questions and fixed answers, requiring users to frame their questions within those limits.

They break down when questions exceed those limits or require context, judgment, or interpretation of institutional rules and responsibilities.

COMPAiSS does not rely on scripts. Each question is evaluated on its own terms, drawing from relevant institutional information to provide clear, detailed, and nuanced answers aligned with what users are actually seeking.

---

## Why COMPAiSS Is Not RAG
![Comparison of Standard RAG AI vs Execution-Gated Institutional AI](/assets/compaiss-funnel-v2.png)

Many AI systems rely on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and post-processing controls to reduce hallucinations after a response has already been generated.

These approaches require additional layers of infrastructure - including retrieval pipelines, vector databases, monitoring systems, validation tools, and ongoing oversight. These components increase complexity and cost, and are typically bundled into expensive enterprise contracts.

COMPAiSS operates earlier.

By preventing unsupported or unanswerable questions from triggering generation in the first place, COMPAiSS prevents unsupported responses from being generated at all, removing the need for costly post-generation cleanup tools and systems. Accuracy and authority are established before any answer is produced, reducing both operational risk and the costs associated with correcting errors.

---

## Architecture

COMPAiSS uses an execution-gated inference architecture.

This means the AI is designed not to operate unless permission is explicitly granted. If authorization fails, the system does not run, reason, or allocate computing resources.

By controlling whether AI reasoning happens at all, COMPAiSS enforces institutional authority structurally, rather than relying on post-generation filtering or correction.

---

![Table 1 – How Different AI Systems Work](/assets/compaiss-table_1-architecture.png)

---

![Table 2 – Detailed System Characteristics](/assets/compaiss-table_2-architecture.png)

---

**These architectural differences are what allow COMPAiSS to operate safely in regulated environments where accuracy is non-negotiable.**

---

## Keeping Meaning Consistent Across Languages

Consumer-based AI systems often translate a question (typically into English) as part of how they search for information, and then translate the answer back into the user’s language. In RAG-based systems, this translation step is intertwined with retrieval and reasoning, meaning that small differences in phrasing can change which sources are selected and what the system emphasizes in its response. Over time, this can lead to inconsistent answers across languages - even when the same question is asked, and even when the same documents are informing the answers.

COMPAiSS is designed to avoid this RAG problem.

COMPAiSS determines what can be answered before language translation comes into play. Institutional scope, authority, and source eligibility are established first using a single, stable meaning of the question, and the authorized answer is then expressed in the user’s chosen language.

As a result, changing the language does not change the authorized answer.

---

## Where Accuracy Is Not Optional

The consequences of incorrect information vary by context. In the highly regulatd environments below, they are not theoretical.

### *Universities*

Universities publish policies governing admissions, academic standing, accommodations, financial aid, degree requirements, and student rights.

An incorrect answer can:
- Misrepresent official policy  
- Lead to improper decisions or appeals  
- Create equity and compliance issues  

COMPAiSS ensures that answers reflect what the institution actually authorizes, not what an AI model infers.

---

### *Hospitals and Health Care Systems*

Hospitals operate under strict clinical, administrative, and regulatory constraints.

Inaccurate information can:
- Misstate patient rights or procedures  
- Create compliance exposure  
- Undermine trust in care delivery  

COMPAiSS limits answers to what the organization can verify and support, preventing speculative or generalized responses.

---

### *Government and Public-Facing Services*

Public agencies provide information that affects benefits, eligibility, obligations, and access to services.

Incorrect guidance can:
- Delay or deny services  
- Create legal exposure  
- Erode public trust  

COMPAiSS ensures that AI-mediated answers remain aligned with official rules, policies, and mandates.

---

## Why This Matters

When institutions provide information, they implicitly promise that it is:
- Accurate  
- Authoritative  
- Reliable  

COMPAiSS extends that same standard into AI-generated answers, because **guessing** is not acceptable.

---

**Regulated institutions deserve AI systems that respect their obligations - not ones that bypass them.**  

**COMPAiSS is designed for institutional environments where accuracy, authority, and governance are non-negotiable.**
