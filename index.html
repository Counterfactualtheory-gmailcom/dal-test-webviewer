# COMPAiSS

### An AI system engineered to prevent hallucinations by design

**Verified answers for environments where accuracy is mandatory.**  
**Where AI stops guessing.**

---

## What COMPAiSS Does

COMPAiSS replaces time-consuming navigation across webpages, policies, procedures, and official documents with **a single authoritative answer** — **and only when that answer can be verified**.

Consumer-oriented AI systems typically address inaccuracies and related risk after a response has already been generated, relying on additional tools, infrastructure, and controls often bundled into very costly enterprise contracts.

COMPAiSS prevents unsupported answers and hallucinations from being generated in the first place. Accuracy and authority are established before the AI is permitted to answer, using authorized information only, without the need for post-generation cleanup.

---

## The Problem with Most AI Systems

Most AI tools:
- Generate responses based on probability rather than authority  
- Attempt to fill gaps when information is incomplete  
- Confidently present incorrect or unsupported answers  
- Shift risk onto the institution  

Across much of the AI industry, hallucinations are treated as an acceptable trade-off for broad access to open-ended knowledge. Errors are expected to occur and are managed after the fact through additional controls, monitoring, and remediation systems — often at significant cost.

Search tools surface information.  
Chatbots summarize it.  
COMPAiSS delivers answers **only when the institution can stand behind them**.

---

## How COMPAiSS Works Differently

COMPAiSS evaluates every question *before* answering.

An answer is produced only when:
- The question falls within an institution’s scope of responsibility  
- Authoritative sources are available  
- The response can be grounded in approved, verified material  

When those conditions are not met, COMPAiSS does not guess.  
Instead, it guides users toward questions that can be answered responsibly or toward the appropriate official channel.

---

## Why COMPAiSS Is Not a FAQ Bot or Scripted Chatbot

FAQ systems are built around predefined questions and fixed answers, requiring users to frame their questions within those limits.

They break down when questions exceed those limits or require context or judgment.

COMPAiSS does not rely on scripts. Each question is evaluated on its own terms, drawing from relevant institutional information to provide clear, detailed, and nuanced answers aligned with what users are actually seeking.

---

## Why COMPAiSS Is Not RAG

Many AI systems rely on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and post-processing controls to reduce hallucinations after a response has already been generated.

These approaches require additional layers of infrastructure — including retrieval pipelines, vector databases, monitoring systems, validation tools, and ongoing oversight. These components increase complexity and cost, and are typically bundled into expensive enterprise contracts.

COMPAiSS operates earlier.

By preventing unsupported or unanswerable questions from triggering generation in the first place, COMPAiSS eliminates hallucinations and removes the need for costly post-generation cleanup tools and systems. Accuracy and authority are established before any answer is produced, reducing both operational risk and the costs associated with correcting errors.

---

## Where Accuracy Is Not Optional

The consequences of incorrect information vary by context.  
In the environments below, they are not theoretical.

---

## Universities

Universities publish policies governing admissions, academic standing, accommodations, financial aid, degree requirements, and student rights.

An incorrect answer can:
- Misrepresent official policy  
- Lead to improper decisions or appeals  
- Create equity and compliance issues  

COMPAiSS ensures that answers reflect **what the institution actually authorizes**, not what an AI model infers.

---

## Hospitals and Health Care Systems

Hospitals operate under strict clinical, administrative, and regulatory constraints.

Inaccurate information can:
- Misstate patient rights or procedures  
- Create compliance exposure  
- Undermine trust in care delivery  

COMPAiSS limits answers to what the organization can verify and support, preventing speculative or generalized responses.

---

## Government Services

Public agencies provide information that affects benefits, eligibility, obligations, and access to services.

Incorrect guidance can:
- Delay or deny services  
- Create legal exposure  
- Erode public trust  

COMPAiSS ensures that AI-mediated answers remain aligned with official rules, policies, and mandates.

---

## Why This Matters

When institutions provide information, they implicitly promise that it is:
- Accurate  
- Authoritative  
- Reliable  

COMPAiSS extends that same standard into AI-generated answers.

Because in these environments, **guessing is not acceptable**.

---

**Regulated institutions deserve AI systems that respect their obligations — not ones that bypass them.**  

*COMPAiSS — guided by deep knowledge.*
