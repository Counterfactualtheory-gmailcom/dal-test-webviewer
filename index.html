### An AI system engineered to prevent hallucinations by design

**Verified answers for environments where accuracy is mandatory.**  

**Where AI stops guessing.**

---

## What COMPAiSS Does

COMPAiSS provides authoritative answers to institution-related questions by operating directly within an organization’s approved policies, procedures, and official materials.

Rather than asking users to navigate multiple webpages, documents, or systems, COMPAiSS produces a single, clear response when — and only when — the institution has defined, verifiable information to support that answer.

When a question cannot be answered responsibly, COMPAiSS does not speculate. Instead, it guides users toward appropriate institutional information or official channels.

---

## The Problem with Most AI Systems

Most AI systems are designed to produce an answer whenever possible.

They generate responses based on probability and pattern recognition, and attempt to manage inaccuracies only after a response has already been generated. As a result, incorrect or unsupported answers are an expected outcome rather than an exception.

Across much of the AI industry, this risk is accepted as the cost of broad access to open-ended knowledge. Errors are addressed through post-generation controls, monitoring, review, and remediation systems — often at significant operational and financial cost.

In regulated institutional environments, this model introduces risk that cannot always be mitigated after the fact.

---

## How COMPAiSS Works Differently

COMPAiSS evaluates each question before any response is generated.

Rather than producing an answer and attempting to correct or constrain it afterward, the system first determines whether the question falls within an institution’s defined scope and whether authoritative material exists to support a response.

This pre-generation evaluation establishes whether an answer can be produced responsibly, before language generation is permitted to occur.

---

## Why COMPAiSS Is Not a FAQ Bot or Scripted Chatbot

FAQ systems are built around predefined questions and fixed answers, requiring users to frame their questions within those limits.

They break down when questions exceed those limits or require context or judgment.

COMPAiSS does not rely on scripts. Each question is evaluated on its own terms, drawing from relevant institutional information to provide clear, detailed, and nuanced answers aligned with what users are actually seeking.

---

## Why COMPAiSS Is Not a General-Purpose AI Model

General-purpose AI systems are designed to operate across the entire universe of knowledge.

They are built to move fluidly across domains, institutions, and jurisdictions, and to answer questions on virtually any subject. This requires them to infer context and generalize across sources that were not created for a single institutional setting.

COMPAiSS is designed for a different operating environment.

It begins within a bounded, institution-defined knowledge space and evaluates questions against that boundary before any response is generated. This allows the system to operate where institutional scope, authority, and accountability must be established in advance.

---

## Why COMPAiSS Is Not RAG
![Comparison of Standard RAG AI vs Execution-Gated Institutional AI](/assets/compaiss-funnel-v2.png)

Many AI systems rely on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and post-processing controls to reduce hallucinations after a response has already been generated.

These approaches require additional layers of infrastructure — including retrieval pipelines, vector databases, monitoring systems, validation tools, and ongoing oversight. These components increase complexity and cost, and are typically bundled into expensive enterprise contracts.

COMPAiSS operates earlier.

By preventing unsupported or unanswerable questions from triggering generation in the first place, COMPAiSS prevents unsupported responses from being generated at all, removing the need for costly post-generation cleanup tools and systems. Accuracy and authority are established before any answer is produced, reducing both operational risk and the costs associated with correcting errors.

---

## Architecture

COMPAiSS uses an execution-gated inference architecture.

This means the AI is designed not to operate unless permission is explicitly granted. If authorization fails, the system does not run, reason, or allocate computing resources.

By controlling whether AI reasoning happens at all, COMPAiSS enforces institutional authority structurally, rather than relying on post-generation filtering or correction.

---

### Detailed System Characteristics

![Table 2 – Detailed System Characteristics](/assets/compaiss-table_2-architecture.png)

---

**These architectural differences are what allow COMPAiSS to operate safely in regulated environments where accuracy is non-negotiable.**

---

## Keeping Meaning Consistent Across Languages

In multilingual environments, many RAG-based AI systems retrieve content in one language and generate answers in another. During this process, meaning is often reshaped — not because the source is wrong, but because translation happens inside retrieval and generation.

When translation and retrieval are intertwined, subtle changes in phrasing can alter which documents are selected, how they are interpreted, and what the system ultimately says. Over time, this leads to inconsistency across languages, even when the same question is asked.

COMPAiSS avoids this problem by separating **meaning** from **language**.

Questions are first normalized to a single, stable meaning before any retrieval or reasoning occurs. Translation is treated purely as a language step — not a discovery step, not an interpretive step, and not a source-selection step.

As a result, changing the language does not change:
- what information is considered relevant
- which institutional materials are used
- or how the answer is determined

This architectural separation prevents interpretive drift and ensures that institutional meaning remains consistent — regardless of the language used.

---

## Where Accuracy Is Not Optional

The consequences of incorrect information vary by context.  
In the environments below, they are not theoretical.

---

## Universities

Universities publish policies governing admissions, academic standing, accommodations, financial aid, degree requirements, and student rights.

An incorrect answer can:
- Misrepresent official policy  
- Lead to improper decisions or appeals  
- Create equity and compliance issues  

COMPAiSS ensures that answers reflect **what the institution actually authorizes**, not what an AI model infers.

---

## Hospitals and Health Care Systems

Hospitals operate under strict clinical, administrative, and regulatory constraints.

Inaccurate information can:
- Misstate patient rights or procedures  
- Create compliance exposure  
- Undermine trust in care delivery  

COMPAiSS limits answers to what the organization can verify and support, preventing speculative or generalized responses.

---

## Government Services

Public agencies provide information that affects benefits, eligibility, obligations, and access to services.

Incorrect guidance can:
- Delay or deny services  
- Create legal exposure  
- Erode public trust  

COMPAiSS ensures that AI-mediated answers remain aligned with official rules, policies, and mandates.

---

## Why This Matters

When institutions provide information, they implicitly promise that it is:
- Accurate  
- Authoritative  
- Reliable  

COMPAiSS extends that same standard into AI-generated answers.

Because in these environments, **guessing is not acceptable**.

---

**Regulated institutions deserve AI systems that respect their obligations — not ones that bypass them.**  

*COMPAiSS is designed for institutional environments where accuracy, authority, and governance are non-negotiable.*
