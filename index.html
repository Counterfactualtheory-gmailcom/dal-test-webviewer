      <h1>COMPAiSS</h1>
      <p class="tagline">
        The AI that knows when <strong>not</strong> to answer.
      </p>
    </section>

    <p>
      COMPAiSS is a new class of institutional AI designed for environments where
      accuracy, authority, and trust matter more than speed or spectacle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most AI systems start by generating answers and try to control risk afterward.
      COMPAiSS reverses that logic.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <p>
        <strong>COMPAiSS asks first:</strong><br/>
        Is AI allowed to answer this question at all?
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>What COMPAiSS Is</h2>

    <p>
      COMPAiSS is an <strong>execution-gated AI architecture</strong> built for large,
      regulated knowledge ecosystems such as universities, public institutions,
      and complex organizations.
    </p>

    <p>
      It helps users navigate official policies, procedures, and institutional
      services — but only when answers can be verified against trusted,
      authoritative sources.
    </p>

    <p>
      If authority cannot be established, COMPAiSS does not guess, hallucinate,
      or improvise.
    </p>

    <h2>Why COMPAiSS Is Different</h2>

    <p>
      Most AI systems rely on probabilities and sound confident even when wrong.
      COMPAiSS operates inside institution-defined truth boundaries.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is not moderation and it is not filtering.
      It is <strong>architectural control</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>What Problem It Solves</h2>

    <p>
      Organizations want AI — but not hallucinated answers, unofficial policy
      interpretations, or governance risk.
    </p>

    <p>
      COMPAiSS enables AI use without surrendering institutional control.
      AI is allowed to operate only when it is safe, accurate, and defensible.
    </p>

    <h2>What COMPAiSS Is Not</h2>

    <p>
      COMPAiSS is not a chatbot.<br/>
      It is not a FAQ bot.<br/>
      It is not RAG by another name.<br/>
      It is not always-on AI.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <p>
        <strong>COMPAiSS is AI with permission.</strong>
      </p>
    </div>

    <footer>
      <p>
        AI doesn’t need to answer everything.<br/>
        It needs to answer the right things, the right way.
